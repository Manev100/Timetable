1. finish EditTimesDialog(2nd Panel), 
   -> join function in first EditTimesDialog toTimeDurations together
2. What to do when adding/deleting times which collides with item dates?
3. let stuff be displayed on table

4. algorithm at conflicting itemdates. new menu item? new dialog?
5. priority option in items?
6. choose between different tables?
7. saving loading!
7.1 on startup, detect inconsistency in data(Items and Timeperiods!), can select to wipe items(or periods)
8. merge edit items and new item. in edit item topmost list item is "new item", like times
