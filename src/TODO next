Road to success! You can do this! Keep working!

1. finish EditTimesDialog(2nd Panel)
2. modify editItemDialog so that you can´t choose times like you want, rather choose from current time periods list. What to do when adding/deleting times which collides with item dates?
3. let stuff be displayed on table
4. algorithm at conflicting itemdates. new menu item? new dialog?
5. priority option in items?
6. choose between different tables?
7. saving loading!
8. merge edit items and new item. in edit item topmost list item is "new item", like times
